My initial steps:
    i) read directions
    ii) reread directions
    iii) feed directions to 4o to get feedback on my understanding of the problem.

2)
    i) Project set-up. Following 4o's advice.
    ii) Got a structure going, but realized it was diverging from the T2a original
    widget design (no certificate, not adaptive enough).
    iii) Giving the old code to 4o to review it and "remind" it of the other requirements.

3) By now, I had a working proto-type. Crazy fast. I then had to test if what it produced
actually supported a sequence of problems, or if it just crapped out after one completed.

I needed more batches. I was content to just have GPT generate them for me, because it is a 
Saturday, and I don't want to do all that right now. THEN, I made sure to vet each sequence,
and I was pretty impressed with what 4o came up with in one-shot. Kinda wild.

I wanted to add more styling and such, but I am not sure I will have time to do so.
